# Jupyter Notebooks

Collection of Jupyter notebooks to illustrate the use of [Unfolded Map SDK](https://docs.unfolded.ai/map-sdk).

## Installation

To use Unfolded Map and Data SDK with Python in Jupyter notebooks, first install them using `pip`:

```
$ pip install unfolded.map-sdk unfolded.data-sdk
```

Unfolded SDKs Jupyter notebook examples with Python also require other packages (libraries). Those dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. 

Install required Python packages with `pip` prior to running demo notebooks:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
